        // so eg [1,2,3,4]
        // 1 has to check 2,3,4
        // 2 has to check 3,4
        // 3 has to check 4
        // 4 dunnid check anything
        // do this every frame or smth
        // this example ah but if u can think of a better way to do it go a head.
        // plan for a lot of entities in the entity list
    }
